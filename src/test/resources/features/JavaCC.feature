  Scenario: Java coding challenges day 8
    Given I print all number from zero up to n = 21
    Then I print negative numbers n = -21 up to zero
    And I have to print my integers in array 1111 2222 3333 7777 9999
    And I print only even integers from array 1111 2222 3333 7777 9999
    Then I check if my array is empty
    And I check if array contains integer 0
    Then I print 20 numbers according to Buzz Fizz rule

  Scenario: Java coding challenges day 10
    Given I input two numbers which are devided by five: numbers are 9.9995 and 10.00005
    Then I add two numbers 0.75 and -9.99 and print addition
    Then I add two numbers -2147483648.0 and 0.0 and print addition
    Then I add two numbers -2147483648.0 and 2147483648.0 and print addition
    Then I add two numbers 0 and 0.000001 and print addition
    Then I add two numbers -1.0001 and 1.0 and print addition
    Then I add two numbers 0 and 0.0 and print addition
    Then I add two numbers 2147483649 and 2147483648.0 and print addition
    And I reverse every third character of a string "WebDriver"
    And I reverse words in a sentence "I am Automation Engineer"
